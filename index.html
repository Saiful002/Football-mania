                    <p>The first president of FIFA was Robert Guérin. Guérin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley
                        Woolfall
                        from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the
                        association
                        football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic
                        predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding
                        principles
                        of FIFA.</p>
